<h2>A Brief Academic Tour</h2>
  <p>Hello there! I'm Yajie Wu, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! 🌟</p>
  <p>I am doing my Ph.D. in Systems Engineering and Operations Research at Penn State University—where I also completed my M.S. in Industrial Engineering, focusing on the Operations Research track. But my academic journey didn't start in the rolling hills of State College, PA. I earned my B.S. in Industrial Engineering with a minor in Applied Mathematics from Beihang University in Beijing, China. </p>

  <h2>Where I'm At 📍</h2>
  <p>You can usually find me in State College, PA, either deeply engrossed in research or possibly exploring local cafes. And when I'm not there, you can always catch me online! You can connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yajiewu">LinkedIn</a> or check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/Kankincredible">Github</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>The Other Side of Me</h2>
  <p>Beyond my academic endeavors, I'm a cat-mom to Timo—a British Shorthair with gem-blue eyes 🐱 that you'll probably fall in love with (not that I'm biased or anything). When I'm not fussing over him, I enjoy diving into a good book, experimenting in the kitchen, or playing the occasional video game to unwind.</p>

  <h2>Get In Touch 💌</h2>
  <p>If you're interested in collaborating, learning more about my research, or simply discussing the intricacies of feline behavior, feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:yajie0408@gmail.com">yajie0408@gmail.com</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Looking forward to connecting with you!</p>
  <p>Cheers, <br> Yajie 😊</p>
