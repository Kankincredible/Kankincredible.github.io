<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Recently, I completed a course on Coursera that explored the fascinating domain of Generative AI and Large Language Models. This course was a game-changer for me, broadening my perspective on artificial intelligence and its possibilities. In this blog post, I'll share some of the key insights and knowledge I gained from the course, including an introduction to Large Language Models and Transformer architecture.

    <h2>The Basics of Generative AI</h2>
    <p>
        The course kicked off by explaining the fundamentals of Generative AIâ€”a subset of artificial intelligence capable of creating new data that closely resembles the data it was trained on. This could range from generating images, text, or even music.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>
    <p>
        One significant part of the course was dedicated to Large Language Models like BERT, GPT, FLAN-T5, etc.. These models have millions, if not billions, of parameters and are trained on vast datasets. Their main function is to predict the next word in a given sequence, but they can also perform a variety of language-related tasks, from translation to summarization.

    <h2>About Transformer Models</h2>
    <p>
        The Transformer architecture forms the backbone of many LLMs. Introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need," Transformers have revolutionized the way we think about sequence modeling. The architecture relies on mechanisms like self-attention to process input data in parallel, as opposed to sequentially, making it highly efficient and scalable.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        Importantly, the course also covered the ethical and technical limitations of these technologies. From biases in data to the risk of misuse, it was crucial to understand both the potential and the pitfalls of generative AI and large language models.
