  <p>Hello there! I'm Yajie Wu, originally from Hebei, China, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! 🌟</p>

  <h2>My Academic and Professional Journey</h2>
  <p>I'm currently engrossed in my Ph.D. studies in Systems Engineering and Operations Research at Penn State, where I also wrapped up my M.S. in Industrial Engineering, specializing in Operations Research. I began my academic path at Beihang University in Beijing, China, earning a B.S. in Industrial Engineering with a minor in Applied Mathematics. </p>
  <p>On the professional side, I've had the opportunity to intern as a Data Scientist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, working on some exciting projects that combined big data, machine learning, and risk prediction.</p>
  <p>And just for a little extra flair—I can speak a bit of French, although I'm still brushing up. 🇫🇷</p>

  <h2>Where I'm At 📍</h2>
  <p>You can usually find me in State College, PA, whether I'm engrossed in research or exploring the local scene. Online, I'm available on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yajiewu">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kankincredible">Github</a>.</p>

  <h2>The Other Side of Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a cat-mom to Timo—a British Shorthair with gem-blue eyes 🐱 that you'll probably fall in love with (not that I'm biased or anything).</p>
  <p>When I'm not in academia or coding away, you'll find me with a good book, a travel itinerary, or at a live concert. Each brings its own kind of joy and inspiration.</p>

  <h2>Contact Me 💌</h2>
  <p>If you're interested in my research, looking to collaborate, or simply want to chat, you're more than welcome to email me at <a href="mailto:yajie0408@gmail.com">yajie0408@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Looking forward to connecting!</p>
  <p>Cheers, <br> Yajie 😊</p>
